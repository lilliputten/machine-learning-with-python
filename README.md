Keras:

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

- Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
- Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
- Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

Keras is a very powerful module that allows us to avoid having to build neural networks from scratch. It also hides a lot of mathematical complexity (that otherwise we would have to implement) inside of helpful packages, modules and methods.

## Description

TensorFlow is an open source framework that makes machine learning and neural networking easier to use.

This freeCodeCamp.org course was created by [Tim Ruscica](https://github.com/techwithtim), also known as [Tech With Tim](https://www.techwithtim.net/).

It will help to understand TensorFlow and some of its powerful capabilities.

All the code examples has been upgraded from tensorflow v.2.15 to v.2.19.
