## Description

TensorFlow is an open source framework that makes machine learning and neural networking easier to use.

This freeCodeCamp.org course was created by [Tim Ruscica](https://github.com/techwithtim), also known as [Tech With Tim](https://www.techwithtim.net/).

It will help to understand TensorFlow and some of its powerful capabilities.

All the code examples has been upgraded from tensorflow v.2.15 to v.2.19.
